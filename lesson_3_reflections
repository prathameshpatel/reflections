When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For sharing with other team members or an open source project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
We might want to decide whch changes and commits to push to the remote repository as we might not be ready for everyone to see those changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are repository clones on GitHub itself. Clones are repository clones from remote to local machines. Branches are a different path in the commit history. We should use all of them as and when needed.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So we can know what is the current head of the remote branch and keeps us updated about how ahead or lagging we are by commits in the tree. Also helps us understand the confilcts in the case we need to pull from the remote. (pull = fetch and merge).
