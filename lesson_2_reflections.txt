What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
We see a .git folder created when we initialize a repositiory. We need to do it to keep track of all the files and the changes made to them in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It wroks as an intermediate stage from where we can choose to commit the files.
